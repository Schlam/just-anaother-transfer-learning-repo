# just-anaother-transfer-learning-repo


using saved weights and data augmentation to vastly reduce computational required for model training. Uses Stanford Dogs dataset.


The modular nature of this package is for my own organization, ultimately the code from this repository will be merged into my fork of George Seif's ```Transfer-Learning-Suite``` to increase the power of that tool
